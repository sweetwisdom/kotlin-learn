# 变量 Variables

[变量](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/kotlin-tour-hello-world.html#variables)



All programs need to be able to store data, and variables help you to do just that. In Kotlin, you can declare:

- 只读 read-only variables with `val`
- 可变 mutable variables with `var`

To assign a value, use the assignment operator `=`.

For example:

```
val popcorn = 5    // There are 5 boxes of popcorn
val hotdog = 7     // There are 7 hotdogs
var customers = 10 // There are 10 customers in the queue

// Some customers leave the queue
customers = 8
println(customers)
// 8
```

## code



```kotlin
package com.pre.learn01

//全局变量

const val todo ="走上人生巅峰"

fun  main(){
    println(todo)
    var name: String= "zhangChao"
    println(name)
    name = "张超"
    println(name)
//    常量不需要设置类型推导
    val sex ="男"
    println(sex)

}
```
